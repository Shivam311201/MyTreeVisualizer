Welcome to Tree Visualizer! It is a React application aiming to help visualize various tree data structures. While learing these data structures I wondered how would they look like if system displayed the nodes and the connections. So I made this project to help someone starting out better understand them. You can play around with it here: [Tree Visualizer](https://vandanrogheliya.github.io/tree-visualizer/) 

# Project contains following data structures:
### Binary Search Tree
### Trie
### AVL Tree
### Red Black Tree
### Max Heap
### Min Heap

# Features visualized in each data structure
## Trie
- Real time searching of a word
- Inserting a word
- Deleting a word
- Insert N random words (Upto 993 words)

## BST
- Inserting a node
- Searching a node
- Deleting a node
- Randomly inserting N nodes
- Traversals
- Balancing tree
- Checking whether tree is empty or not

## AVL Tree
- Same as BST except balancing feature (As it is a self balancing tree)
- Heights a displayed in the node

## Red Black Tree
- Same as AVL Tree
- Nodes are colored black or red

## Min heap and Max Heap
- Inserting a node
- Extracting the top most node
- Deleting a node

I personally really enjoyed making Trie. When nodes lighted up when I typed in the search bar really excited me. I hope you enjoy learing with my creation.
