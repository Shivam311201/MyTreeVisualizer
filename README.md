Welcome to Tree Visualizer! It is a React application aiming to help visualize various tree data structures. While learning them I was drawing trees again and again. So I wondered how easier it would be if the system displayed the structure. Hence I made this project to help someone starting with trees and also to give me a better understanding of them. 


# Project comprises the following data structures:
### Binary Search Tree
### AVL Tree

# Features visualized in each data structure
## BST
- Inserting a node
- Searching a node
- Deleting a node
- Traversals

## AVL Tree
- Same as BST except balancing feature (As it is a self-balancing tree)
- Heights a displayed in the node
