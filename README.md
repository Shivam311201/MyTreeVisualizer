Welcome to Tree Visualizer! It is a React application aiming to help visualize various tree data structures. While learning them I was drawing trees again and again. So I wondered how easier it would be if the system displayed the structure. Hence I made this project to help someone starting with trees and also to give me a better understanding of them. 

You can play around with it here: [Tree Visualizer](https://vandanrogheliya.github.io/tree-visualizer/) 

# Project comprises the following data structures:
### Binary Search Tree
### Trie
### AVL Tree
### Red Black Tree
### Max Heap
### Min Heap

# Features visualized in each data structure
## Trie
- Real-time searching of a word
- Inserting a word
- Deleting a word
- Insert N random words (up to 993 words, but limited by screen size)

## BST
- Inserting a node
- Searching a node
- Deleting a node
- Randomly inserting N nodes
- Traversals
- Balancing tree
- Checking whether the tree is balanced, full, complete or perfect

## AVL Tree
- Same as BST except balancing feature (As it is a self-balancing tree)
- Heights a displayed in the node

## Red Black Tree
- Same as AVL Tree
- Nodes are coloured black or red

## Min heap and Max Heap
- Inserting a node
- Extracting the topmost node
- Deleting a node

I personally really relished making Trie. When nodes lighted up when I typed in the search bar amazed me. I hope you enjoy learning with my creation.
